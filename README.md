# Finance-Api
## Approach
#### This approach to bulid Finance API using python,django and django rest framework(DRF),The api will provide endpoints for managing financial transactions, users, and generating financial reports.

## Limitations
### - The Endpoint 4 and 5 after doing a lot of search we can not reach the accurate result to implement the endpoints
### Endpoint 4: `/api/users/<user_id>/transactions/` (GET)
### - Allow users to retrieve their own transactions based on user ID
### Endpoint 5: `/api/reports/` (GET)
### - Implement an endpoint that generates financial reports, such as monthly or yearly
### summaries of transactions, for a given user
